1.  In Assignment 1, I Wrote an ipython notebook that demonstrates visually in a data-driven way the Central Limit Theorem.

      I generated 100 samples of random sizes N (10 to2000) from each of 5 different distributions, including a Chi-Squared     distribution, a Normal distribution, a Poisson distribution, a Binomial distribution,and a Uniform distribution(500 samples in total), all with the same population mean 100. 
      For each sample, I plotted the sample mean against the sample size N and described the behavior in the plots in terms of the law of large numbers or Central Limit Theorem, and then plotted the distributions of all sample means together for each distribution.

2.  In Assignment 2, I set up A work for data-driven inference based on CitiBike data.

      I first stated a question about the relationship between the number of bikers and their ages,  and then formulated the Null and Alternative hypothesis.
      I downloaded the 2014 February's CitiBike file and read the file used pandas, finally plotted the data distributions related to the question.

3.   In Assignment 3,  I used the Z test to understand if the implementation of an alternative bus route for bus line X8       improves circulation. I set up the null and alternative hypothesis and its significance level, calculated the z statistics based on the formula using the data given, and then made a conclusion based on the z statistics.
