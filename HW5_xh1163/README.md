In HW 1, we are responsible to review our classmate's Citibike project proposal, to verify it their Null and alternative hypotheses are formulated correctly and if the data was properly pre-processed to answer the question, and to suggest an appropriate test to test H0 given the type of data.

The peer repository assigned to me is pmb434. I have forked the repository, created a CitibikeReview markdown file, and requested a pull o the original repository to share the markdown.
