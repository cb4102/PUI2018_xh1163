It would be best if the plot is embedded in the README.md as required. I took screen shots of the final plot and its caption from the assignment 1 notebook.

Review: 
  
You did a very good job on the plot caption explaining what the heatmap shows and what does the darker color in the map mean. However, there is something that can be improved. First of all, the color of the blue dot is too close to the background color of the map, which makes them hard to observe on the map. Change the dots color to some bright color such as orange or red will make the plot more readable. Second, the legend of the map might also cause some confusion, because the legend was representing in different color dots, which will easily make the reader think the legend is for the blue dots, not for the map. Maybe consider changing the legend, or using other shapes instead of dots to present the location.
