# PUI2018_xh1163

This folder contains Week one's Homework of PUI class. 

In Homework 1, I was responsible to create an Environmental variable "PUI2018" that points to the PUI2018 directory I created, and also create an alias "pui2018" as a shortcut of comment that takes to that directory when called. 

While setting the enviromental variable and alias, I also need to make sure that they are permanently saved in the bash_profile and can be used for later. 

The Screenshots folder include a screenshot of the bash_profile file where you can see the alias and enviromental variable I created, and one of my terscreenshotsminal which shows a series of commands and their output to show that the enviromental variable and alias are actually exist and work well.
