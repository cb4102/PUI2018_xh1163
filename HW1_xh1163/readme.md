# PUI2018_xh1163

This folder contains Week 1's Homework for the PUI class. 

In Homework 1, I was responsible in creating an Environmental variable "PUI2018" that points to the PUI2018 directory I have created, and also setting up an alias "pui2018" as a shortcut of commend that takes me to that directory. 

While setting up the enviromental variable and alias, I also need to make sure that they are permanently saved in the bash_profile and can be used for later. 

The Screenshots folder include a screenshot of the bash_profile file where you can see the alias and enviromental variable I created, and a screenshot of my terminal which shows a series of commands and their output to show that the enviromental variable and alias actually exist and work well.
